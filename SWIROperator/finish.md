### Recap

In this scenario we covered:

#### How to create and deploy a simple multi micorservice solution into SWIR Platform

We demonstated that each micorservice has a super simple configuration and simply focuses on implementing the business logic. All hard but repeatable functionality is offloaded to SWIR Sidecar. Without SWIR Sidecar each microservice stays in a dormant state.

#### How to use SWIR Kubernetes operator to configure our solution 

We demonstated the potential of Kubernetes operators to configure and manage solutions. We used SWIR Kubernetes operator to inject SWIR Sidecar and configure it correctly so the microservice could start functioning as part of a larger solution.
